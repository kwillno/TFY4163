	<h3>Numerical Assignments</h3>

<p>These are the numerical projects that are subject-material for the subject Wavephysics and Fluidmechanics (BÃ¸lgefysikk og Fluidmekanikk, TFY4163) at NTNU (Norwegian University of Science and Technology).
  
The assignments follow progression throughout the semester and get progressivly more difficult, applying physical phenomena as well as more advanced numerical methods for solving differential equations.  
  
Below there is a list of due dates for the different assignments.</p>
 
<ul>
	<li>Numerical Assignment 1  
  		<ul><li>January 23rd</li></ul>
  	</li>
	<li>Numerical Assignment 2
  		<ul><li>February 20th</li></ul>
  	</li>
	<li>Numerical Assignment 3
  		<ul><li>March 12th</li></ul>
	</li>
</ul>

	<h3> Numerical Project </h3>

<p>The numerical project is a larger assignment that is handed in in the second half of the semester, applying many of the physical and numerical methods taught earlier in the course.  

The scope of the project involves both wavephysics and fluidmechanics as well as advanced numerical methods. The project is to be handed in March 20th.  
  
In addition both the project and the assignments are to be handed in using Jupyter Notebook(a graphical interface packaged with Anaconda).</p>
