# Numerical Assignments

These are the numerical projects that are subject-material for the subject Wavephysics and Fluidmechanics (BÃ¸lgefysikk og Fluidmekanikk, TFY4163) at NTNU (Norwegian University of Science and Technology).
  
The assignments follow progression throughout the semester and get progressivly more difficult, applying physical phenomena as well as more advanced numerical methods for solving differential equations.  
  
Below there is a list of due dates for the different assignments.
  
- Numerical Assignment 1
 -- January 23
- Numerical Assignment 2
 -- February 20
